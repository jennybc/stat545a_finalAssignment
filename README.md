STAT545A: Final Assignment
========================
*Mina Park*

This is the repository for the final assignment for STAT545A. For this assignment, I used data from the [OECD statistics database](http://www.oecd.org/statistics/). 

Sparked by [this article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/canadas-voluntary-census-is-worthless-heres-why/article14674558/) on the changes to the long-form census and its ensuing lack of reliability, I was interested in seeing what inequality and poverty rates looked like in Canada over the period for which data was available.
